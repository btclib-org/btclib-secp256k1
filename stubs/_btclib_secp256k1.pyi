"""Type stub for the cffi generated extension module.

The extension is built at install time and has no source to inspect, so
without this stub mypy sees `ffi` and `lib` as `Any` and every wrapper in
the package type-checks vacuously: the whole codebase is a thin layer
over these two objects.

Only the surface the package actually uses is declared. `lib` stays `Any`
on purpose: its members are the ~100 libsecp256k1 entry points, declared
in C and generated at build time, so a hand-written stub for them would
be a second source of truth that nothing keeps honest.

`unpack` is narrowed to bytes. In general it returns bytes, str or a
list, depending on the cdata type; the package only ever unpacks
`char[]`, which is the bytes case.

`buffer` answers a writable view of what a cdata owns, and its length is
that of the memory rather than of a pointer to it: `_secret` reads both
from it. `memoryview` is what it is used as -- sliced, assigned to, and
measured -- so that is what it is declared to return.

`from_buffer` and `memmove` are the two halves of what a caller's own 32
octets can become. The first re-views them as the item type the boundary
takes, without copying and while keeping the memory alive, which is
`_scalar._owned_octets`; the second fills a buffer this package allocated
from either a `bytes` or a cdata, which is `_secret.scalar_buffer`, where
a copy is owed because libsecp256k1 writes through the pointer or because
this package wipes it afterwards.

`addressof` is how a field of a struct is passed where libsecp256k1 wants
a pointer to it: the found outputs of `silentpayments` carry an x-only
public key and a label by value, and each has to reach its own serializer.

`typeof` resolves a cdecl once, at import, for the buffers whose
declaration is built by an f-string, and `new` takes what it answers as
well as a string. `_CType` is what says so: with `Any` there instead,
`new` accepts anything at all -- `ffi.new(_XONLY_SIZE)`, an int where a
cdecl belongs, and the size and the type it was built from now sit a
dozen lines apart in the same module -- which is the vacuous
type-checking this file exists to prevent.

`typeof` also answers *about* a cdata, which is how `_scalar.scalar`
asks whether the 32 octets it was handed are an array of them: the
parameter is therefore `Any`, as `sizeof`'s already is for taking either
a cdecl or a cdata, cdata being what this file cannot name. The three
fields of `_CType` are the ones that question reads -- the kind, the
element type, and the name to put in the exception -- and they are here
rather than opaque because something now reads them.
