    That is SHA256(SHA256(tag) || SHA256(tag) || msg): the tag separates
    the domains of the protocols using it, so that what one of them signs
    cannot be read as a message of another. The BIP340 challenge and the
    BIP341 taproot tags (TapLeaf, TapBranch, TapTweak) are built with it.

    Args:
        tag_bytes: the domain separation tag, of any length.
        msg_bytes: the message to hash, of any length.

    Returns:
        The 32-byte tagged hash.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if libsecp256k1 fails, which no input can make it
            do.
