    """Compute the ECDH shared secret from an already-parsed public key.

    The private half of `shared_secret`, for a caller who already holds
    the other party's parsed key -- one exchanging with the same
    counterparty more than once, or one that validated the key on
    receipt: see the package docstring for what the two underscores mean
    throughout.

    Args:
        pubkey: the other party's already-parsed public key, as
            `keys.parse` returns.
        prvkey: this party's private key, 32 bytes or an int below
            2**256.
        into: a writable 32-byte buffer to receive the result, instead
            of the `bytes` this otherwise returns. See `_secret.take`
            and SECURITY.md for what that does and does not buy.

    Returns:
        The 32-byte shared secret, the SHA256 of the compressed shared
        point as `shared_secret` documents it -- or None where `into`
        was given and holds it.

        **A key libsecp256k1 cannot read answers 32 bytes here too, and
        they are a shared secret with nobody.** A `secp256k1_pubkey`
        nothing has written to is reported through the illegal callback,
        which this does not read, and the call succeeds: nothing raises
        and nothing about the answer says it is worthless. That is the
        one place in this package where an unusable object produces a
        value a caller could take for a secret, and `context.check`
        immediately after the call is the only thing that says
        otherwise. `shared_secret` parses the octets it is given and so
        has no such case; a caller holding a key of its own has it, and
        proving that key once with `keys.pubkey_verify` is what removes
        it.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if `into` is not a writable bytearray or memoryview
            of octets.
        ValueError: if the private key is not 32 bytes, does not fit in

    The result is the SHA256 of the compressed shared point, i.e. the
    libsecp256k1 default hash function; it is computed in constant time.

    The hash function is not configurable, by decision. libsecp256k1
    takes it as a C callback, so exposing it would mean calling back into
    python from the middle of the computation, with the shared point
    passing through python objects; and it would buy nothing, the point
    being available as keys.pubkey_tweak_mul(pubkey_bytes, prvkey),
    itself constant time. A protocol needing another derivation applies
    it to that: SHA256 of it is what this function returns. Wanting both
    of them is where the private halves earn their keep -- one
    `keys.parse`, then `_shared_secret_` and `keys._pubkey_tweak_mul_` of
    it -- the two public halves parsing the same key twice.
