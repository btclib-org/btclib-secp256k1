    signature: CData, msg_bytes: bytes, prvkey_bytes: bytes, pubkey: CData | None
) -> None:
    """Recover from a signature just made, and refuse another key.

    What `dsa` and `ssa` do after signing, in the shape a recoverable
    signature asks for. Bitcoin Core makes the same distinction:
    `CKey::Sign` ends in `secp256k1_ecdsa_verify`, and `CKey::SignCompact`
    ends in `secp256k1_ecdsa_recover` followed by
    `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_cmp` against the key that signed.

    The reason is the recovery id, which is what this signature has
    beyond a plain one and what a verification does not look at. A
    signature carrying the wrong id verifies perfectly and recovers
    somebody else's key -- and recovering a key is the one thing a caller
    of this module is going to do with it, so the check has to be the one
    the id answers.

    It subsumes the verification exactly rather than probably, which is
    what makes not verifying safe here. Recovery is not selective: for a
    given id it answers *the* key under which that `r` and `s` verify, so
    an inconsistent pair does not fail, it comes back as a different key
    -- and fails only where `r` is not the x of a point at all, which is
    the branch below that reports no key recovering.
    So the recovered key is by construction the key that verifies the
    signature, and `recovered == signer` is a verification with the id
    checked besides.

    Named as `ssa._abort_unless_verified` is, and for the same reason:
    it raises where a `_foo_` half would answer, and the verb is the one
    BIP340 uses of the step.

    **A key handed in is compared with instead of derived**, which is
    `dsa._checked`'s arrangement and buys the same
    `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` here, at the same price it costs there:
    what is dearest in this package is the check, not the saving. What it
    costs is that a mismatch now has three causes where `dsa`'s has two:
    the key given is not this private key's, the recovery id is not the
    signature's, or
    the computation faulted. The first is an argument and the other two
    are not, and one comparison separates them -- the recovered key
    against the derived one, paid only where something already went
    wrong. Where they agree, the signature is the signer's and it is the
    argument that is wrong; where they do not, the signature does not
    recover its own signer, which is what a wrong id and a fault both
    look like from here and neither is anything the caller passed.

    That those two share an answer is the decision rather than an
    oversight. A caller of `sign` cannot pass an id at all -- it comes
    back from `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable` beside the signature --
    so an id that is not the signature's is a fault by the time this
    runs, and `test_the_recovery_id_is_what_the_check_catches` reaches
    that state the only way anything can: through the parsed signature
    this private half takes.

    **Neither call below needs a `context.check` behind it, and both are
    the kind that usually would.** `keys._pubkey_cmp_` answers an
    ordering that means nothing where libsecp256k1 could not read an
    object, and that answer is a security decision here. One of the two
    objects is no longer proved by a preceding success: `recovered` is,
    but `pubkey` is what this half takes on trust, and a caller handing
    in a `secp256k1_pubkey` nothing has written to reaches
    `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_cmp` with it -- so an illegal argument *is*
    recorded on the thread here, which the comparison against a derived
    key could not do. What holds instead is the comparison itself:
    libsecp256k1 serializes a key it cannot load as 33 zero octets,
    documented there as "less than any valid public key", and the
    recovered key is readable and serializes with an `0x02` or `0x03`
    prefix. So the `0` still cannot lie -- an unreadable key compares
    *unequal*, the fall-through derives, and what the caller is told is
    that the key they gave is not this private key's, which is the truth
    about it. `dsa._verify_` documents the same trust from the other
    side, and `dsa._checked` passes such a key straight into it. And
    `keys._pubkey_from_prvkey_` raises a `ValueError` for a key outside
    [1, n-1], which this one is not: libsecp256k1 accepted it for signing
    immediately above. That is why `_recover_`'s `ValueError` is
    converted below and this one is not -- the first reports a property
    of the signature, which a fault can change, and the second a property
    of an argument that has already been proved. `dsa._sign_` leaves the
    same call unconverted for the same reason.

    Args:

    `verify` is what `dsa.sign` and `ssa.sign` take, in the shape this
    signature asks for: the key is recovered from the signature and
    compared with the signer's, rather than the signature verified
    against it. That is Bitcoin Core's own distinction between
    `CKey::Sign` and `CKey::SignCompact`, and the reason is the recovery
    id -- a verification does not look at it, so a signature carrying the
    wrong one verifies and then recovers a key that is not the signer's.
    Recovering is what a caller of this module does with the answer, so
    the check is the one that question deserves.

    What it catches is not a bad argument -- those have all raised by
    then -- but a computation gone wrong, by bad memory or by a fault
    induced on purpose, whose cost is a published signature that is
    invalid or attributes itself to somebody else.

    It is also the dearest of the three, which is the other half of what
    a caller weighing it needs: 34.41 microseconds against 12.02, where
    `dsa.sign` measured beside it in the same session was 31.54 against
    12.06 and `ssa.sign` is 28.57 against 15.87. A recovery is about a
    verification's work, and the comparison and the derivation are the
    rest. CHANGELOG.md names the session.

    `pubkey` is how a caller already holding the key stops the comparison
    deriving it, and what it removes is the same call `dsa.sign` removes,
    at the same price: the check here is the dearest of the three, the
    saving is not. In a session of its own: 35.00 microseconds with the
    key derived, 29.67 with a compressed one handed in, 27.49 with an
    uncompressed one, against 12.07 unchecked and a noise of
    ±0.02. The 7.51 that removes is `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create`, which
    timed alone there is 7.53, and what stays is the recovery and the
    comparison -- about 3 microseconds over what `dsa.sign` pays for a
    verification, whether the key is handed in or derived. The README
    carries both tables, and `_abort_unless_recovered` what the trust
    costs in diagnosis.

        verify: whether to recover the key and refuse a signature that
            does not give the signer's back. It costs a recovery, a point
            multiplication and a comparison, and False is what a caller
            that has measured those against its own threat model passes.
        pubkey: the public key of this private key, where the caller
            already holds it, so that the comparison does not derive it
            again. That derivation is the multiplication named above, and
            this is how not to pay it twice. It is taken on trust rather
            than checked against the private key, which would cost the
            multiplication it saves; where it is wrong, the check says so
            and says which of the three things went wrong. Refused
            beside `verify=False`, which declines the check it is for.

    Returns:
        The 64-byte compact signature and its recovery id. The id is 0
        or 1 for any signature this function produces; 2 and 3 exist for
        a nonce point whose x exceeded the group order, which no key
        reaches in practice.
