    Protects against side-channel leakage, as libsecp256k1 recommends,
    and is called below on the shared context at import time.

    Repeating it is a caller's to do and needs exclusive access to the
    context: this is one of the few libsecp256k1 calls that mutates one,
    and the header says to randomize at creation time -- which is what
    happens below -- or to hold a read-write lock. Everything else in
    these bindings is safe to call from several threads *because* the
    shared context is randomized once, before any of them exists, so a
    second call on `ctx` while another thread is signing takes that
    guarantee away. See the Thread safety section of the README.

    The context is an argument rather than the module-level `ctx` for
    the same reason `_load_lib` takes the module: a line called once, at
    import, is a line no test can reach afterwards -- and what is worth
    reaching here is the 32, an entropy requirement of
    secp256k1_context_randomize that no answer this package returns
    would reveal if it were wrong.

def check() -> None:
    """Raise what libsecp256k1 reported on this thread, if anything.

    The message is the failed precondition itself, as libsecp256k1
    stringifies the condition of its own check: signing twice with the
    same MuSig2 secret nonce, for one, is reported as the failed magic
    check of the nonce that the first signature zeroed.

    It is for a call made through `lib` directly, as a MuSig2 session
    is, and it is the caller's to make: no wrapper in this package calls
    it, so what it reports is whatever was recorded last on this thread
    by anything at all. Call it immediately after the call whose return
    value you are explaining, and read nothing into a message from any
    other one.

    A wrapper is one of those others. Handed an object libsecp256k1
    cannot read, a wrapper answers its own verdict -- `False` from a
    verification, `None` from a sum, its own `ValueError` where a return
    code let it raise -- and the reason is recorded here on the way past.
    So a message on the thread may be a wrapper's rather than the
    caller's, which is the whole of why this asks to be called at once.

    What was recorded is cleared, so a second call reports nothing and
    a later one cannot inherit this call's message.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if libsecp256k1 reported a violated precondition.

            precedence, being the graver of the two.
