# How to contribute

<!-- The toolchain badges are here rather than in the README because they
report no state: each names a choice, and this is the file that says how
the choice is enforced and what the command for it is. The README keeps the
badges that can turn red. btclib and bitcoin-core-rpc do the same, with a
cal_ver badge this project has no use for: the version tracks the vendored
libsecp256k1 release rather than the calendar. -->

Thank you for investing your time in this project. What follows is how to
build and test these bindings, and what this repository
expects of a change. What the build itself does on each platform is in
the [Build](./README.md#build) section of the README, which is not repeated
here.

Please read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) too.

What this repository holds in common with its siblings — the toolchain,
the lint gate, the tool tables behind it, the workflow set and the branch
rules — is stated once in the
[btclib-org repository standard](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github/blob/main/README.md),
each rule with the alternative it was decided against. It binds this
repository, so a change departing from it is a divergence, and one filed
as an issue in that repository rather than here: a difference between two
repositories belongs to neither of them.

## Which project is this

These are thin python bindings to
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1). Three
repositories are easy to confuse, and an issue in the wrong one is slow
to route:

- the cryptography is upstream, in
  [bitcoin-core/secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues).
  It is vendored as the `secp256k1` submodule and only ever read from: a
  flaw in the library itself is not ours to fix
- anything with state of its own — a wallet, a transaction, a signing
  session — belongs in
  [btclib](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib/issues), which is what
  these bindings are for. The Design section of the README says where the
  line is
- what belongs here is how the bindings drive the library: the wrapping,
  the argument validation at the cffi boundary, the packaging, and the
  wheels

A vulnerability is never an issue: see the
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Opening an issue

Search the [issues](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/issues)
and [pull requests](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/pulls)
first, then use one of the
[forms](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/issues/new/choose).
The bug form asks which of the three artifacts is installed — a static
wheel, a dynamic one, or a build from the sdist — because they differ in
how libsecp256k1 is linked and a bug is rarely in all three.

Issues are not assigned to anyone: if one interests you, you are welcome
to open a pull request for it.

## Building and testing

The btclib_secp256k1 project includes
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1)
as submodule in the secp256k1 folder.
By default, when cloning a project you get the directories that contain
submodules, but none of the files within them.
You must run `git submodule init` to initialize
your local configuration file,
and `git submodule update` to fetch the submodule data
and check out the appropriate commit.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```console
$ git submodule init
Submodule 'secp256k1' (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git) registered for path 'secp256k1'
$ git submodule update
Cloning into 'secp256k1'...
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the
development environment. The interpreter it is built on is pinned in
`.python-version`, and uv installs it if missing: neither pyenv nor a
hand-made virtualenv is needed. The development dependencies are the
PEP 735 groups declared in `pyproject.toml`.

```shell
uv sync
```

This also builds and installs the extension in editable mode, so the
C toolchain the README describes must be available.

To build:

```shell
uv build --sdist
uv build --wheel
```

To test:

```shell
uv run pytest
```

To measure the code coverage provided by tests:

```shell
uv run pytest --cov
```

Coverage is measured in branch mode and gated by the `fail_under`
ratchet in `pyproject.toml`; the same check runs in CI.

To run everything CI checks before a PR, i.e. the formatter, the
linters and the type checker:

```shell
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To time these bindings against the other python wrappers of
libsecp256k1, clone
[btclib-benchmarks](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-benchmarks) and
run `scripts/libsecp256k1_wrappers.py` there. The comparands are that
project's dependencies rather than this one's, which is the point: btclib
is one of them, and btclib is what depends on these bindings.

To test against another supported interpreter, bypass the build cache:
uv keys it on the sources, which do not tell it that the compiled
extension belongs to one ABI version only.

```shell
uv run --python 3.10 --no-cache pytest
```

On a Windows arm64 machine, mind which interpreter that request gets:
uv installs an x86-64 one unless the architecture is named
(`--python cpython-3.13-windows-aarch64`), reporting that support for
the native architecture is not yet mature. Both work — the build follows
the interpreter — but only the native one exercises what the `win_arm64`
wheels are.

Beware that this replaces `.venv` with an environment built on that
interpreter, and leaves it there. Going back is another `uv sync`, and
`--reinstall-package btclib_secp256k1 --no-cache` if the extension it
finds in the cache is the one of the ABI just left behind. Requesting a
free-threaded interpreter (`--python 3.14t`) has a second effect: it
installs it as a managed one, and `uv sync` then prefers it to a system
3.14, so `uv python install 3.14` is what makes the default environment
reproducible again.

Naming the environment keeps the default one instead, at the price of a
second build of the extension:

```shell
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-3.10 uv run --python 3.10 --no-cache pytest
```

`.gitignore` matches that name with `.venv*/`, the comment beside the
pattern saying what ships the environment when nothing matches it.

### The editor

`.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` are tracked, and they
hold no preference: the recommended extensions are the tools
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` already runs, and the settings put the fixing ones
on save. Installing them is optional and changes nothing about what a commit
enforces — what they buy is learning of a finding while typing rather than
at the commit that trips over it.

Anything machine-local — an interpreter path, a telemetry answer, a theme —
belongs in the editor's own user settings instead, those two files being
read by every checkout of this repository.

### What runs when

| workflow | when | what it varies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test` | pull request, push | the wheels, the sdist, one suite cell |
| `lint`, `docs` | pull request, push | — |
| `claude-review` | pull request, and `@claude` in a comment | — |
| `vendored-vectors` | weekly, a change to itself | — |
| `codeql` | push to main, and weekly | the two scanned languages |
| `os-ubuntu` | weekly, a release | both ubuntu images × every interpreter |
| `os-macos` | weekly, a release | both macOS images × every interpreter |
| `os-windows` | weekly, a release | both Windows images × every interpreter |
| `deps-latest` | weekly | the dependencies, at their newest |
| `links`, `mutation` | weekly | — |
| `pypi-published` | weekly, a release | what PyPI serves |
| `release` | a tag | calls the gates and the rows marked *a release* |

The first two rows are what a merge waits for, and the suite cell among them
is one: `ubuntu-latest` on the interpreter `.python-version` pins, measured
for coverage. Which day each of the rest runs, and at which minute, is
section 10 of the organization standard in `btclib-org/.github` and not this
file's to restate — one calendar covering the organization is one thing to
remember, and a copy of it per repository is one more thing to keep true in
each.

Why so little gates is one number: GitHub Free gives an organization twenty
concurrent jobs (as of 2026-08-21), shared across every repository in it. A
commit here, in btclib and in bitcoin-core-rpc each ask for more jobs than
that ceiling alone allows, so a pull request in any of the three spent its
wall clock waiting for a slot. At that ceiling a cell before a review buys a
rarer answer at the price of every review: macOS runners queue for tens of
minutes rather than for two, and the twenty-one Windows suite cells were
27.3 of a run's 112.9 runner-minutes, the largest family of jobs in it and
ahead of every wheel build. The numbers are in `test.yml`'s header.

**What the sentinels vary, they vary whole.** `os-ubuntu` runs both images
on every interpreter, the cell the gate already covers included. A matrix with
the gate's cell cut out of it is one nobody can read the shape of, and
whoever asked what ran would have to re-derive the hole from the gate.

**Every image still builds wheels on every pull request**: `cibuildwheel`
runs the suite against each wheel as it builds it, and the release publishes
the artifacts of a run that built every one. What narrows on a branch is how
many per image — one interpreter's rather than every interpreter's, ubuntu
included — because what a pull request asks of an image is whether this tree
still builds there, and the toolchain, the CMake build of the vendored
library and the cffi extension are what differ per image rather than per
interpreter. Nothing on a branch reads past that first build: `check-dist`
installs one wheel by path and takes it from `build-dynamic`, which builds
whole. `test.yml` carries the measurement beside the step.

What a pull request no longer asks is pip's *selection* among a directory of
wheels tagged for several interpreters, which now runs nowhere; the wheel
each interpreter would get is still tested by the job that builds it, and
`os-ubuntu`, `os-macos` and `os-windows` still compile both linkages from
the tree on every interpreter. What no run asks at all is the suite
against the dynamic wheel as a package — the sentinels compile that
linkage from the tree instead. `os-ubuntu.yml`'s header records both
costs beside each other.

Everything but the first two rows also takes `workflow_dispatch`, which for
`codeql` and the three platform workflows is the only way to ask about a
branch at all. `claude-review` is the exception that takes none: both its
jobs read the pull request or the comment that triggered them, so a manual
run would start with nothing to read.

`codeql` runs on `main` and on its weekly schedule and not on a pull
request, which is the same arithmetic as the rows above: three slots held
while a review waits. What still reads a branch before it merges is
`zizmor`, a `pre-commit` hook and therefore part of `lint`, which audits
these workflows for an injected expression; REPOSITORY.md has the trade in
full. It is also the one workflow with no local command: reproducing it
means the CodeQL CLI, a bundle GitHub distributes rather than a dependency
`uv.lock` can pin, so what answers a finding is the run itself and the
Security tab beside it.

### Running what CI runs

Each job of the `lint`, `docs` and `test` workflows, and the local command
that reproduces it. Two of them cannot be reproduced on a machine that is
not the runner, and that is worth knowing before trying; `codeql` has no
command at all, for the reason above, and no longer gates.

- `Lint and type-check`

  ```shell
  uvx pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

- `Ask which files the pull request touches`, whose answer decides whether
  the rest of `test.yml` runs at all

  ```shell
  gh api "repos/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/pulls/<number>/files" \
      --paginate --jq '.[].filename' > files.txt
  eval "$(/usr/bin/grep -m1 '^ *prose=' .github/workflows/test.yml)"
  if [ ! -s files.txt ] || /usr/bin/grep -qvE "$prose" files.txt; then
      echo "everything runs"
  else
      echo "prose only"
  fi
  ```

  The second line lifts the pattern out of the workflow rather than
  restating it here, so the two cannot drift. `/usr/bin/grep` rather than
  `grep`, because where the shell's is [ugrep](https://ugrep.com) the
  third line answers the opposite question: ugrep takes the status from
  whether the *pattern* matched anywhere and inverts that, rather than
  from whether `-v` selected a line. A list of only prose and a list of
  only code come out right either way; one mixing the two exits 1 and
  reads as "prose only", which is the direction that skips a matrix that
  should have run, and nothing says it has. `-q` is what asks the
  question of the file rather than of the lines, and ugrep takes the same
  path when the output is discarded, so `-cvE` and a numeric test agree
  with both greps. The runner's `grep` is GNU's, so what ugrep can get
  wrong here is the reproduction and not the workflow
  (<https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/issues/242>)

- `Measure coverage, gated at 100%`

  ```shell
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test pytest --cov
  ```

- `Build wheels on <os>`, for this platform only

  ```shell
  uv run --frozen --only-group build cibuildwheel
  ```

  `--frozen`, not `--locked`: `test.yml` has the reason, next to the step
  itself. The Linux wheels of that job are built in a manylinux
  container, so reproducing them needs a container runtime (`colima` on
  macOS)

- `Build dynamic wheel on <os>`

  ```shell
  BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_DYNAMIC=true uv build --wheel
  ```

  on macOS the job exports a deployment target first, and reproducing it
  means exporting the same one:

  ```shell
  export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0    # 10.13 on x86_64
  ```

  a dynamic wheel compiles no extension, so nothing derives its platform
  tag from a toolchain: without that variable `hatch_build.py` falls back
  to `platform.mac_ver()`, and the wheel comes out `macosx_26_0_arm64` on
  a macOS 26 machine — a tag `pip` refuses on every older macOS the file
  would in fact have loaded on. CMake reads the same variable, so the
  vendored library is built for the floor the tag then claims; the two
  values and the reasoning behind them are in `test.yml`, next to the
  step that exports them

- `Build sdist`, and `Install from the sdist and run the suite on <os>`
  after it

  ```shell
  uv build --sdist
  python -m pip install --verbose dist/*.tar.gz   # in a fresh venv
  ```

- `Inspect the distribution files and install one`

  ```shell
  uv run --locked --only-group check twine check --strict dist/*
  uv run --locked --only-group check check-wheel-contents dist/*.whl
  uv run --locked --only-group check pyroma --min 10 dist/*.tar.gz
  ```

- `Build on Linux for Windows` needs `mingw-w64`, and a Linux host to be
  faithful: the cross-compilation CI does is from ubuntu, not from macOS

- `test: every job passed` reproduces as nothing, and is here because it
  is the required check and therefore the one a contributor sees red: it
  reads the conclusions of the jobs above it and runs no command of its
  own. What turned it red is one of them, in the run

- `Build the documentation`, the same command `.readthedocs.yaml` runs
  and `docs/README.rst` documents. Needs the submodule checked out,
  unlike btclib's own equivalent job: every `automodule` directive
  imports this package, which means compiling libsecp256k1 first

  ```shell
  git submodule update --init
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group docs \
      sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs/source docs/build/html
  ```

The `pypi-published` workflow has no local equivalent by design: what it
installs is what PyPI serves.

The sentinels beside it gate nothing, so a red one is read in the Actions
tab rather than fixed on a branch. Each is dispatchable, and all but `links`
run locally.

- `os-ubuntu`, `os-macos` and `os-windows`, the suite on both images of
  a platform and on every interpreter, so only the row matching the
  machine at hand reproduces. A cell is these two commands in this order —
  the coverage job's own command without `--cov`, run once against each
  linkage, with `--python` standing for the interpreter the row names:

  ```shell
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --python 3.10 pytest
  BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_DYNAMIC=true uv run --locked --no-default-groups \
      --group test --python 3.10 --reinstall-package btclib_secp256k1 \
      --no-cache pytest
  ```

  the second re-installs rather than reusing what the first built,
  because neither the environment nor the build cache is keyed on the
  variable that chooses the linkage. `--cov` is not in either: what a cell
  asks is whether an (image, interpreter) pair passes, and coverage is
  measured and gated once, on the gate's cell

- `deps-latest`, which resolves every dependency at its newest before
  running the suite. The upgrade rewrites `uv.lock`, so restore it
  afterwards with `git checkout uv.lock`:

  ```shell
  uv lock --upgrade
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test pytest
  ```

- `links` needs a tool uv does not provide, lychee being a rust binary, so
  the workflow uses the action. `.lycheeignore` holds the URLs a checker
  cannot judge, each with the reason it cannot be checked rather than the
  reason checking it is inconvenient

- `mutation`, scoped by `.github/mutation/bindings.toml`, which is what the
  workflow reads too:

  ```shell
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
      cosmic-ray baseline .github/mutation/bindings.toml
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
      cosmic-ray init .github/mutation/bindings.toml bindings.sqlite
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
      cr-filter-operators bindings.sqlite .github/mutation/bindings.toml
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
      cosmic-ray exec .github/mutation/bindings.toml bindings.sqlite
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
      cr-report --surviving-only --show-diff bindings.sqlite
  uv run --locked --no-default-groups \
      python .github/scripts/mutation_counts.py bindings.sqlite
  ```

  `baseline` first, always: it runs the configured test command against the
  unmutated tree, and without it a stale command fails every mutant
  identically and the session reports a perfect kill rate — the one failure
  mode of a mutation run that looks like good news. The session mutates the
  source in place and restores it, so nothing else may read the tree while
  it runs: no second session, no `pytest` in another shell, and a
  `git status` in the middle is a working tree with a mutant in it. `exec`
  is resumable, so interrupting one costs only the mutant it was on, and the
  `.sqlite` is what the workflow uploads beside the reports — `cr-report`,
  `cr-html` and the counter all read one.

  `cr-filter-operators` marks as skipped what the configuration excludes by
  operator, which here is every mutant of a `|` in an annotation: none of
  them is reachable by any test, and an unreachable mutant costs a whole run
  of the suite to survive. Skipping them is what leaves a survivor list
  somebody reads to the end — the comment in `bindings.toml` carries the
  grep that keeps the exclusion honest.

  `--surviving-only` is the whole of what anybody acts on, a killed mutant
  being the suite doing its job. Read the list expecting nothing: the two
  shapes that used to be in it — an output buffer sized twice, and
  generated randomness whose length no answer reveals — were answered in
  the code rather than excused in a comment, and the session that measured
  that reported no survivor at all. So whatever is in the list is a test
  nobody has written yet.

  The counter last, and not `cr-rate`: that tool reads anything that is not
  SURVIVED as a kill, so it counts the skipped mutants among them and
  divides by the whole session. `mutation_counts.py` prints killed, survived
  and skipped with the rate over what actually ran, and exits non-zero on an
  outcome that is no verdict at all — an INCOMPETENT mutant, or a worker
  that raised, which is Cosmic Ray not having measured rather than a test
  that is missing.

## What a change has to satisfy

`main` is the only long-lived branch, so that is what a pull request
targets and where every change lands; a tag on `main` is a release.

- **the pre-commit hooks pass.** `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` runs
  the formatter, the linters and the type checker; the `lint` workflow
  runs that very configuration, so what CI enforces is what the hook
  does. `uvx pre-commit install` makes it a commit hook
- **the tests pass with full coverage.** `uv run pytest --cov`; the
  `fail_under` ratchet in `pyproject.toml` is what makes the number mean
  something, so new code arrives with the tests that cover its branches
- **the secret-scanning baseline follows the vectors.** The test data is
  private keys, so `detect-secrets` would report all of it; the known
  findings are recorded as reviewed rather than excluded, in two baselines
  that differ only in whether the entropy detectors run. Adding a hex
  constant to a test module, or a vector to a file under `tests/` matching
  `*.csv` or `*.json`, fails the corresponding hook until its baseline is
  regenerated:

  ```shell
  # the tree, entropy detectors on. --slim omits `line_number` and
  # `generated_at`, so the file stops changing when a flagged line
  # moves; a fresh scan rather than `--baseline`, which writes the full
  # form whatever it read -- `--slim` reaches `format_for_output` only on
  # the branch that prints to stdout -- and therefore the exclusion
  # spelled out rather than read back from the baseline's own filter
  uvx --from detect-secrets detect-secrets scan --slim \
      --exclude-files '^(\.secrets\..*baseline|tests/.*\.(csv|json))$' \
      > .secrets.baseline

  # the vendored vector data, entropy detectors off: these files are
  # 64-character hex and nothing else, so a new vector would read as a
  # new secret. The paths are the hook's `files` pattern spelled out
  uvx --from detect-secrets detect-secrets scan --slim \
      --disable-plugin HexHighEntropyString \
      --disable-plugin Base64HighEntropyString \
      tests/*.csv tests/*.json \
      > .secrets.vectors.baseline
  ```

  Both are slim, and what that costs is one field of the diff: a new
  secret still arrives as a new `hashed_secret` under its filename, and
  finding *where* it is takes a grep instead of a line number.
  `detect-secrets audit` needs the full form and says so, which is a
  reason to regenerate without `--slim` for an audit rather than to keep
  the churn in the committed file.

  The redirect costs a second thing, which is the one to know before
  auditing: `--baseline` does not only save, it **merges**, and what it
  carries forward is exactly the audit's product — `is_secret` and
  `is_verified` per finding, "verification of secrets, both automated and
  manual" in its own words. A scan into a file has no old baseline to
  merge, so those marks go back to their defaults, and slim output prints
  no `is_secret` at all when it is unset: the loss shows up as a diff of
  nothing. `jq '[.results[][]] | length' .secrets.baseline` (and the
  same against `.secrets.vectors.baseline`) is how to check whether
  there is anything to lose — every finding in either file being
  unverified and none carrying `is_secret` means there isn't, today —
  but an audit's marks want saving elsewhere or re-applying after the
  next regeneration.

  read the diff before committing it, which is the whole point of a
  baseline: what appears there is what nobody has looked at yet
- **new wrapped functionality is validated against external vectors.**
  A test that compares these bindings against themselves proves nothing.
  `tests/test_vectors.py` documents where each vendored vector file comes
  from — BIP340, RFC6979, trezor-firmware — and a new wrapper should
  reach for something published elsewhere in the same way
- **a new wrapper checks sizes and delegates the rest.** What the
  boundary is for is stopping a short buffer from reaching a bare
  pointer; whether the bytes are a valid key, point or signature is
  libsecp256k1's answer to give, and an argument of the wrong size or
  form raises rather than being padded or reinterpreted into a valid one.
  The reasoning is in the README, under What the boundary checks
- **the prose satisfies the section below.** The workflows, the build
  scripts and the configuration files in this repository carry the
  reasoning behind their choices, because that is the part a reader
  cannot recover, and a hook can check that a docstring exists but not
  what it says
- **the vendored submodule moves on purpose.** Bumping `secp256k1` is a
  change of what this package wraps: it belongs in its own pull request,
  with the version named in the README and in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` moved
  with it. Dependabot signals upstream movement but tracks the default
  branch, so a release always needs the tagged commit

### Documentation and comments

What "satisfies" means for the prose is written down here, because a hook
can check that a docstring exists and not what it says. It governs the
workflows, `pyproject.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as much as the
package: the reasoning with its negative results is what makes those
files reviewable rather than merely readable.

**Tone of voice: neutral, factual, dry.** The same register everywhere:
no jokes, no salesmanship, no emphasis where the fact is enough.
Explanatory detail is wanted; decoration is not.

**Length is a cost, and the reason is what buys it.** One sentence where
one will carry it, and a paragraph only where a shorter one would leave
the reader wrong. Three habits lengthen prose here without adding to it,
and each is worth deleting on sight:

- the same reason in a second wording — not emphasis, but a second copy
  to keep true, and the one that drifts;
- the sentence that only introduces the next one;
- the tour of alternatives, where the rejected one and the thing that
  rejects it are the whole of the negative result.

Nothing checks prose the way the suite checks code, so every line of it
is one a later change can falsify in silence. That is what its length is
weighed against.

**A docstring states the contract.** What the function takes, what it
returns or raises, and the rule the behaviour comes from — not a
restatement of the name. In the package the first two are enforced:
`pydoclint` requires an `Args` entry per parameter and a `Returns`
section, in the Google style napoleon renders, so a new argument that
nobody documented fails the gate. `Raises` is not enforced and is still
required — these wrappers raise mostly through what they call, so the
check that compares a `Raises` section with the body's own `raise`
statements would ask the docstrings to be wrong; `pyproject.toml` says
so where it turns that check off.

A test's docstring states what it verifies: the property, the published
vector, the failure mode, and which side of the assertion is the
independent one. That last part is why a docstring is required of a test
at all — the name says which call is under test, which is not the same as
what is being claimed about it.

**An example is executed.** Anything written as a doctest, in a docstring
or in README.md, is run by `tests/test_examples.py` on every interpreter
and every kind of wheel. That constrains an example to be deterministic —
fixed keys, and a verification rather than a signature wherever the value
depends on randomness that is not pinned — which is the price of the one
form of documentation this repository can gate like a test.

**A comment carries the reasoning, including the negative result.** Say
why the code is as it is and why *not* the obvious alternative. The second
half is what stops the next reader from "fixing" a deliberate choice, and
it is why this repository's configuration files are as long as they are.

**Cite the authority.** Where behaviour comes from a BIP, an RFC, or
libsecp256k1 itself, name it rather than asserting the behaviour as if
these bindings had decided it. Where they deviate, say so and say why.

**Measure, don't assert.** A number in prose comes from a command, and the
command belongs beside it, so the next reader can re-measure instead of
trusting a figure whose date they cannot see. Never state a count that
nothing checks — an unchecked number drifts into a false claim — and never
state how many of anything a file or a matrix holds: a stated total is a
line every open branch has to edit, and two branches moving it to the same
wrong number merge without a conflict. A dated measurement is the
exception, and it is dated for exactly that reason.

**One fact in one place.** Two files stating the same thing become two
files disagreeing about it; the second one points at the first. That is
why [REPOSITORY.md](./REPOSITORY.md) holds the repository settings and
CLAUDE.md points at it.

**No history in the prose.** Comments and docstrings say why the code is
as it is, in the present tense; they do not tell the story of what it used
to be. "This is here rather than X because X breaks Y" stays, whatever
prompted it; "this used to be X, until Z" goes — unless the old spelling
is something a caller can still encounter, in which case it is not history
but the present. History has a file of its own,
[RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md), and the commit messages.

## Pull requests

The whole build and test matrix — tens of jobs, each compiling
libsecp256k1 from source — runs on every pull request and on every push
to it, which is deliberate: this package exists to be identical
everywhere. It does mean a draft pull request is the polite place for
work in progress.

Every change starts with an open issue; `Closes #N` in the pull
request's description is what closes it, once a reviewed pull request
merges. A pull request needs an approving review from somebody other
than its author before it can merge — GitHub refuses a self-approval.
[REVIEWING.md](./REVIEWING.md) is the standard that review is written
against, and is this file's other half: what a review establishes before
it gives an ack, how a finding states its severity, and why everything it
notices that the pull request is not about becomes an issue rather than a
comment. Read before opening a pull request, it is what the pull request
will be answered against. Allow maintainer edits so the branch can be
updated for a merge, and mark review conversations resolved as you
address them.

`main` enforces four things on every commit that reaches it, not only
at review time: a verified signature, linear history, no force push, no
branch deletion. These run as a GitHub ruleset with no bypass actor —
not a rule trusted to hold on its own — so a commit that is unsigned, or
a push that rewrites history, is rejected before it is something to
review. A verified signature is GPG, SSH or S/MIME; GitHub's
[documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
has what counts and how to set one up.

**A correction is a commit of its own, never an amend.** Once a branch is
pushed and under review, `git commit --amend` and a force-push replace the
commits the review is attached to: the reviewer loses the diff they read,
"changes since your last review" has nothing to compare against, and every
one of those matrix jobs starts again from a commit nobody has seen. Add
the fix on top, with a message saying what it fixes, and reply to the
comment with the sha. Two force-pushes carry no new work, and stay right
for that reason. One is yours: a `git rebase origin/main` on a branch
whose base has moved, which wants the gates re-run after it, not only
before, and a note in the pull request saying the head moved. The other
is the maintainer's and comes at the end, your branch's own commits
collapsed into the one about to land — the paragraph after next is where
that is, and it is worth expecting rather than reading as a rewrite of
the review.

Nothing is lost in `main`'s history by working that way, because a pull
request lands as one commit: a branch of several is squashed into one
whose subject is the pull request title with its number, so the review's
commits are the record of the review and `main` keeps one commit per
landed change. A merge commit would put the branch's steps into `main`
and a rebase merge would replay them one by one — `main` is linear by
branch rule, and one change is one commit there.

**How that commit reaches `main` is the squash button**, pressed by
auto-merge once the review and the checks are in. GitHub composes it and
signs it with its web-flow key, which is a valid signature and therefore
all the branch rule asks for. There is no other way in: `main` takes a
pull request and nothing else, a direct push being refused for everyone.
REPOSITORY.md has the settings that make that true, and what the other
two merge methods would have cost.

What a pull request set to merge itself once the checks go green is
holding is `gh pr view <n> --json autoMergeRequest`.

None of that changes the shape of a correction: it is decided at the
landing and not on the branch, so a fix added on top of a reviewed branch
is still the right shape — by the time it is squashed the review has its
record.
Enabling it is the way to not wait for a matrix that compiles C on every
platform, and what it costs is the paragraph above: GitHub signs what it
composes, so a pull request left to merge itself lands a commit signed
by the web-flow key rather than by the maintainer, and one whose sha the
branch never carried. GitHub only offers it while something is still
pending, and it merges nothing the branch rule would not have let
through by hand.

Releases are cut by a maintainer, following [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md);
nothing about a version needs to be touched in a pull request.
