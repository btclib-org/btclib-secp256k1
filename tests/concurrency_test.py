"""Concurrent use of the shared libsecp256k1 context.

The bindings hold one context, created and randomized at import time and
passed to every call. That is safe because a context is only mutated by
secp256k1_context_randomize, which runs once before any thread exists,
and because each call allocates the buffers it writes to; but nothing in
the code says so, and a static wheel is built for the free-threaded
interpreter (cp314t), where these calls are no longer serialized by an
interpreter lock.

Every operation exercised here is deterministic, ECDSA by RFC6979 and
BIP340 by a fixed aux_rand32, so a result that differs between threads
is a shared buffer, not a legitimate difference.

`ssa.Signer` and `keys.PubkeyTweakChain` are what hold a buffer across
calls, and the second test is the half of the reasoning that does not
follow from the paragraph above: what makes a shared signer safe is that
libsecp256k1 takes a keypair const. A chain is not shared and is not
tested as if it were: `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_add` takes its key as
in and out, so every `tweak_add` writes the point the chain holds, and
one chain belongs to one thread. What is tested of it here is that a
chain per thread answers what a chain alone answers.

`musig.SecretNonce` is neither of those two shapes. It is not const, like
a keypair, and it is not one-thread-per-object by convention, like a
chain: it is meant to be read exactly once, from whichever thread gets
there first, and refused everywhere else -- the invariant the whole class
exists to hold, a secnonce driving `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` twice
being how MuSig2 leaks the private key. `SecretNonce._take` makes the
read and the clear one atomic step under a lock private to the instance,
and the last test here is what that buys: `WORKERS` threads racing one
`SecretNonce`, of which exactly one may ever sign.
