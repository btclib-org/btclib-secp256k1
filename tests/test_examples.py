"""Every example in the documentation is executed.

An example nobody runs is documentation that stops being true silently,
and the README's own example was one: it sat there through five
releases with nothing to notice if the call it shows had changed shape.

`doctest` is used through the standard library rather than through
pytest's `--doctest-modules`, and the reason is what this package is.
`testpaths` is `tests`, and widening it to the package would collect the
*source* tree -- which is the right thing locally, where the extension
is an editable build of it, and the wrong thing in the wheel jobs, where
what has to be exercised is the module inside the installed wheel.
Importing the package by name gets whichever of the two is installed, on
every one of the eleven kinds of wheel, which is the point.

The examples are therefore constrained to be deterministic: fixed keys,
and a verification rather than a signature wherever the value depends on
randomness that is not pinned.
