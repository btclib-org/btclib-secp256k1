"""Invariants of the bindings, over many inputs rather than a few.

The rest of the suite pins results down against published vectors and a
handful of small keys. What that leaves out is not a line or a branch,
all of which are covered, but a wrong result on an input nobody wrote
down: with the private keys 1, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13, no public key has an
x coordinate starting with a zero byte, and no signature is one of the
few whose DER encoding is 69 bytes long.

So the inputs here are derived, not chosen: a chain of SHA256, which
gives variety without randomness. A failure is reproducible at the exact
iteration, and nothing has to be installed to generate it.

The properties are the bindings' own, never a second implementation of
secp256k1: a round trip returning what it started from, a scalar
operation agreeing with the point operation it corresponds to, two
parties agreeing on a shared secret. Where an independent reference does
exist without one, hashlib, it is used.

Breadth is what the sweep is for. The cases too rare to be reached by it
reliably are pinned at the end, with the property each exhibits asserted
rather than assumed.
