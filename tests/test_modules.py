"""Tests for the ecdh, recovery and ellswift libsecp256k1 modules.

Wherever possible the results are cross-checked against the other
bindings (dsa, ssa, keys) instead of against vendored constants: the
ECDH secret is recomputed from the shared point, and the recoverable
signature is compared with the deterministic ECDSA one.

`musig` has its own tests, in `tests/test_musig.py`: it is the one
module here that holds state across calls, which is a different shape
of test from the other three, one call each against an equation checked
another way.
