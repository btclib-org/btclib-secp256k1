"""A signer checks its own signature before answering with it.

BIP340 puts the check inside *Default Signing* -- "If Verify(bytes(P), m,
sig) returns failure, abort" -- and Bitcoin Core's `CKey::Sign` does the
same for ECDSA without offering a way out, both for the same reason: a
computation that went wrong, whether by bad memory or by an induced
fault, yields a signature that is invalid and may say something about the
key, and the protection is not publishing one.

`recovery` asks a different question for the same reason, as Core's
`CKey::SignCompact` does: it recovers the key from the signature and
refuses one that is not the signer's, the recovery id being what this
signature has beyond a plain one and what a verification does not look
at. So the refusal substituted below is per module rather than one for
all three.

For `dsa` and `ssa` the fault itself is out of reach -- no input makes a
fresh signature fail its own verification -- so what the two share is the
four things around it: that the check changes no signature, that it is on
where nothing asks, that a refusal is wired to the raise rather than
merely written near it, and that `verify=False` does not reach the check
at all.

The last two are one substituted verification read in both directions,
and the second of them is the one nothing else covers: the signature is
the same bytes whether or not the flag was honoured, so a `verify`
ignored altogether would answer exactly what it should. Replacing every
`if verify:` in the package with `if True:` leaves every other test here
passing.

`ssa` adds a fifth of its own, and it is not about the raise but about
which key the check reads: BIP340 negates an odd-y key before verifying,
and `test_the_keypair_is_checked_against_the_key_that_signed` holds the
check to that same rule -- the failure it rules out is a check that
passes for the wrong reason. It signs under keys of both parities and
asserts both occur.

`recovery` adds a fifth of its own too, and it is the one that says what
the check is for rather than that the raise is wired to it. There the
fault *is* reachable from an input -- a wrong recovery id is one
`parse_compact` away -- so `test_the_recovery_id_is_what_the_check_catches`
needs no stand-in at all: it signs, re-parses under each id, and holds
real libsecp256k1 to refusing every one but the signature's own, while a
verification of the same octets still succeeds.

`dsa` adds a group of its own, for the public key a caller may hand the
check instead of having it derived. Those turn on the key being taken on
trust: what it costs -- a failure that has two causes, told apart in both
directions, one of them needing the same stand-in as above -- and what it
cannot cost, which is a signature wrongly accepted. That last one is the
strongest thing in this file, and it is a property over many keys rather
than a case.

`recovery` takes the same key and adds the group after it, where the
failure has three causes rather than two: the key given, the recovery id,
or the computation. The first is an argument and the other two are not,
and what separates them is the derivation the matching path skipped.
`test_a_wrong_id_under_a_right_key_is_not_reported_as_a_wrong_key` is the
one nothing else in the package can write -- a right key and a wrong id,
both real, no stand-in anywhere -- and the property over many keys is
asserted again there, because what makes the trust safe is a different
sentence when the key is recovered rather than verified against.

Each group also asserts the saving itself, which no other case of the
argument can see: with the multiplication substituted for one that
raises, `test_the_derivation_the_argument_saves_is_not_made_at_all` and
`test_the_derivation_the_recoverable_check_saves_is_not_made_at_all` hold
the signature to coming back anyway, so the derivation a key handed in
skips is asserted absent rather than only priced.
