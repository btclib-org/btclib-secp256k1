"""The mypy hook's pins are the versions `uv.lock` resolves.

The type gate runs in an environment of its own: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
gives the mirror a `rev` and a list of `additional_dependencies`, and
pre-commit builds that environment once and keeps it. The editor cannot
use it -- this package is a compiled extension and the import does not
resolve where nothing built one -- so what the editor reads is the
project environment instead, and the two are the same mypy only while the
two declarations say the same thing.

Nothing made them say it. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` records that they are
"moved by hand, with the lint and test groups of uv.lock", which is a
procedure rather than a check, and section 4 of the organization standard
names that second declaration as the price of this branch. This module is
what turns the procedure into a red test: a `uv lock` that moves one of
these and a hand that does not follow is the whole of what it catches,
and it is silent -- both environments still build, and mypy still passes
in each, against different versions.

Parsed rather than loaded. `uv.lock` is toml and the floor here is 3.10,
where `tomllib` is not yet in the standard library, which is the reason
`copyright_test.py` beside this one reads pyproject.toml the same way;
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` is yaml and no group here carries a parser for
it. Both shapes are narrow enough to match: a `[[package]]` table with a
name and a version, and a two-space-indented `- name==version` under the
key that lists them.
