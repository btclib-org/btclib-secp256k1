"""The interpreters this package claims are the ones it runs on.

One fact, declared three times: `requires-python` is the floor,
`Programming Language :: Python :: X.Y` is what PyPI shows whoever is
choosing the package, and the platform sentinels' own lists are what
actually runs. Nothing compared them, and the three drift in the
direction that is hardest to notice -- a classifier left behind when a
floor moves is a package advertising an interpreter its suite never
touches, and the person it misleads is not reading this repository.

The sentinels are where the interpreter set lives because that is where
the suite meets every interpreter: the merge gate runs one cell, on the
version `.python-version` pins, and `os-ubuntu.yml`'s header says why. Each
of the three carries the list in full, and each of their comments says
the other two carry the same one, so the list is read per file and the
three are required to agree: a version added to one and forgotten in
another is a difference between platforms, which is the one thing a
platform sweep is arranged so as not to have.

The organization standard's rule is that a library covers every Python
that is not out of support, so all three move together twice around each
October: one version leaves support as another is released. This module
does not know that calendar and does not try to -- python.org keeps it,
and a test that hard-coded a date would be one more thing to move. What
it holds is the weaker and checkable claim: whatever the three say, they
say the same thing.

Read with a regex rather than parsed. `tomllib` arrives in 3.11 and the
floor here is 3.10, which is the reason `copyright_test.py` reads
pyproject.toml the same way; a workflow is yaml and no group here
carries a parser for it.
