"""The nonce each signer derives, held to the signature it produced.

A nonce is checked against nothing but itself unless something else
knows it, and here that something is the signature: `r` is the x
coordinate of the nonce times the generator, reduced modulo the group
order, and BIP340's `R` is the same x without the reduction. So every
assertion below signs and then re-derives, which is what makes these
wrappers an oracle rather than a second implementation to trust.
