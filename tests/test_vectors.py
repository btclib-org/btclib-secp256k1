"""Tests against independent, publicly documented test vectors.

- BIP340: bip340_test_vectors.csv, vendored from
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340/test-vectors.csv
- BIP324: bip324_ellswift_decode_test_vectors.csv and
  bip324_packet_encoding_test_vectors.csv, vendored from
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0324; the second is
  the packet encoding suite, of which the ellswift/private key inputs
  and the shared secret are what these bindings compute
- BIP327: bip327_key_agg_vectors.json, bip327_nonce_agg_vectors.json,
  bip327_sign_verify_vectors.json and bip327_sig_agg_vectors.json,
  vendored from
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0327/vectors
- BIP352: bip352_send_and_receive_test_vectors.json, vendored from
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json;
  both directions of every case are driven, the eligibility of an input
  being read off the keys the file itself publishes rather than off its
  scripts -- see `bip352_eligible`
- ECDSA RFC6979: (k, r, s) vectors published in
  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=285142.msg3300992
  as vendored by trezor-firmware (crypto/tests/test_check.c,
  test_rfc6979) and bitcoinjs-lib (test/fixtures/ecdsa.json);
  each vector is also self-checked here asserting r == x(k*G)
- deterministic ECDSA and DER encodings from trezor-firmware
  (crypto/tests/test_check.c, test_ecdsa_sign_digest_deterministic
  and test_ecdsa_der)
- low-r grinding, from the two implementations of the scheme this
  package copies: bitcoin/bitcoin src/test/key_tests.cpp, both the
  fixed signatures of `key_test1` and the property `key_signature_tests`
  asserts over 256 messages, and rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1 src/lib.rs
  `test_low_r`, whose vector is the one that takes more than one attempt
- ecdsa_sig.json and ecdsa_custom_nonce_sig.json, the ECDSA vectors
  used by btclib, vendored from
  https://github.com/rustyrussell/secp256k1-py (tests/data);
  note: the rfc6979.json vectors used by btclib are NOT imported,
  as they only cover NIST curves (per RFC 6979 appendix A.2),
  not secp256k1
- the recovery id 2 and 3 fixture, which is published nowhere and is
  constructed here instead, against arithmetic this file does itself.
  Its derivation is documented where it is built
