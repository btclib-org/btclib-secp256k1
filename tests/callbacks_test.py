"""Tests of what libsecp256k1 reports through the callbacks of the context.

No wrapper reads those callbacks, so what they record is `context.check`'s
to raise and nobody else's. Two halves are tested here. That `check`
itself reports, clears and attributes per thread; and that a wrapper
handed an object libsecp256k1 cannot read answers *something* -- its own
exception where a return code allowed one, and otherwise a value that
means nothing -- while leaving the reason on the thread for a `check`
that follows.

The second half is the contract a caller has to know, so each of its
shapes is driven rather than described: a raise whose message is the
wrapper's own, a `False` from a verification, an ordering from a
comparison, and 32 bytes from an ECDH that succeeded with nobody. The
public entry points are the counter-case, parsing their octets and so
leaving the thread clean.

One of those shapes is not an object the caller handed `lib` but an
argument of a wrapper: the public key `recovery._sign_` compares against
is taken on trust, so an unreadable one is recorded on the thread from
inside a call that answers its own `ValueError` about the key. That the
verdict is right anyway is the reasoning that docstring gives, and the
last test here is it.

An internal error is reachable through neither: libsecp256k1 reports
through that callback what it holds to be unreachable, so the recording
function is called directly, the way extension_test.py drives the branch
of the loader that the build it runs on does not have.
