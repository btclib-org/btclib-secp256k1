"""Every private half answers what its public half answers.

`_foo_` means one thing across these bindings, and the package docstring
states it: the wrapper takes the parsed object in place of the octets,
and the public half is that same call with a `parse` in front of it, a
`serialize` behind it, or both. That is an equality, so it is written as
one here, pair by pair and -- where the object is a public key -- over
both serializations of it, which is what keeps the two halves from
drifting into two implementations of the same thing.

`test_every_private_half_is_paired` holds the tables to the modules' own
contents, so a private half added and not paired here is visible as an
absence rather than as a test nobody wrote.
