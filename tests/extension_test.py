"""Tests of what installing the package provides, rather than its source.

That is the extension module and the distribution metadata.

One package works with both extensions: the static one, which has
libsecp256k1 linked in, and the dynamic one (cffi ABI mode), which has
to find at run time the shared library shipped beside it. Whichever
build these tests run on, the branch of _load_lib taken by the import
itself is the only one that exists, so the search is driven here with a
stand-in module: what is checked is not that a library can be loaded,
but that a directory not holding one is reported instead of being
mistaken for one.
