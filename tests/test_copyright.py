"""LICENSE and pyproject.toml's author, checked together.

btclib's own LICENSE named "Ferdinando M. Ametrano and btclib
contributors" for years after the rest of that project had moved to "The
btclib developers", with nothing comparing the two (btclib#389). LICENSE
here named "Giacomo Caironi" the same way, against this project's own
COPYRIGHT and `authors` already saying "The btclib developers" -- caught
by hand, not by a check, which is what this one is.

Regex rather than `tomllib` for the one line wanted out of
pyproject.toml: the floor here is 3.10, and `tomllib` is 3.11. Once that
floor moves, this can read the file directly instead.
