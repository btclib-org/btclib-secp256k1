"""Hatchling build hook: what the compiled extension makes of the wheel.

The extension is built by scripts/cffi_build.py; what is decided here is
how the wheel that carries it is labelled and what goes into it. Two
answers, and which one applies is a property of the build rather than of
this file: a static wheel has libsecp256k1 linked into a `cpNN` extension
and takes the tag hatchling infers for the interpreter, while a dynamic
one compiles no C at all and is tagged `py3-none-<platform>`, the shared
object travelling beside it as a forced include.

See scripts/README.md for the three build paths, and README.md for why
the distinction reaches the installed package at all.

        `py3-none-<platform>` for a dynamic one.

        Raises RuntimeError unless the modules agree on which of the two it

        editable paths make in place of the check above, so it is
        rebound on the live `WheelBuilder` instance to return the same
