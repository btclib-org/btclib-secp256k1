"""Build the vendored libsecp256k1 and the cffi extension over it.

Three build paths, and which one runs is decided by the environment
rather than by an argument: static with MSVC on native Windows, static
with the interpreter's own toolchain everywhere else, and dynamic (cffi
ABI mode) where no C is compiled at all. `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_DYNAMIC`
picks the third, `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_CROSS_COMPILE` forces it for a
target whose interpreter cannot be run here, and `CFFI_PLATFORM` names
the platform being built for when it is not the one running.

Two classes: `FFIExtension` is the shape of a build with the three steps
a subclass has to answer, and `Secp256k1CFFIExtension` is this project's
one. scripts/README.md walks the file; the module is also loaded by
`exec()` from scripts/hatch_build.py, which is why nothing here depends
on being importable.

        uv installs an emulated x86-64 CPython there by default (native
