"""Re-check every vendored-vector pin against upstream, monthly.

tests/README.md pins each of the three vendored vectors to a commit and
a git blob SHA-1, with a documented manual procedure to re-check one.
This automates that procedure and reports drift, rather than fixing it:
refreshing a vector file is a decision this script does not get to
make, so what it opens is an issue, never a commit. Ported from
btclib's own check_vendored_vectors.py, which this package's README
convention matches by design (issue #397).

Scope is narrower than the README could need, even though nothing in
this project's own three entries currently uses the narrower part: only
an entry whose `behind` already reads 0 -- what a human last confirmed
was exactly at upstream's tip -- is checked. An entry already
documented as behind would be a decision already made, and
re-reporting the same gap every month would be noise rather than news;
btclib's own README has that shape today, this one does not yet.

A path upstream has renamed or deleted is reported rather than raising:
it has no commit to name as a tip, and a pin standing on a file that is
not there any more is the one drift nobody would otherwise notice.

Two more shapes this script does not attempt, for the same reason
btclib's does not, present or not in this project's own README today: a
path carrying a `<name>` placeholder, where one pin serves several
files at once, and an entry with no `commit` at all. Every heading the
README carries but this script did not check is listed in its own
report, so nothing silently reads as "checked and clean" that was not
checked at all.
